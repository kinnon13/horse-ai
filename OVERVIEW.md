# HORSE.AI
## The Global Performance Horse Ledger

---

## What It Is

**Horse.AI is the official public record for performance horses.**

It tracks runs, payouts, bloodlines, offspring earnings, sale status, and buying interest across barrel racing, rope horses, reining, cutting, cow horse, futurity colts, embryos, and stallion programs — worldwide.

**It is not a social app. It's not Facebook drama. It's not a classifieds group.**

**It's the scoreboard and the marketplace.**

*If it didn't happen on Horse.AI, it basically didn't happen.*

---

## Core Value Proposition

Horse.AI answers 4 questions instantly, for anybody:
- **Who ran what**
- **Who got paid** 
- **Who owns/bred that horse**
- **How do I buy into that bloodline**

This applies to a 1D youth mare in Texas, a rope gelding headed to Mexico, a cutting-bred stud selling frozen, or a futurity baby someone is trying to syndicate in Brazil.

**You ask Horse.AI, and you get the truth.**

## How Data Gets In

We don't beg. The world feeds us data because it benefits them.

### 1. Producers (Free Forever)
- Show producers upload event draws, times, placings, and payouts for free
- In return they get instant "winner cards" and "official results" credit
- Their data is marked as "Producer Submitted" with community flagging for accuracy
- **Result**: Horse.AI becomes the source of truth for performance

### 2. Riders / Parents / Breeders / Trainers
- Anyone can look up a horse, mare, stallion, kid, or program in HorseGPT (the AI)
- If they want more detail, Horse.AI asks them to help verify: "Who owns this horse? Is she for sale? Is she open for embryos? What's the sire/dam?"
- They answer, we improve the record
- **Result**: Free traffic = free data

### 3. Buyers
- Buyers can hit "Request Info" on a horse, mare, stallion, embryo, or hauling/training
- That creates a lead captured inside the platform, not a random DM
- **Result**: Horse.AI sits in the middle of the deal

**We are building the performance + bloodline graph automatically, in real time, using ego, money, and brag instinct.**

## How People Use It

### Fans and Riders
They open Horse.AI and see:
- Fastest runs this weekend
- Top mares this month  
- Stallions whose babies are winning right now

**It's all public. No "$30 PDF report." No gate to browse.**

### Breeders and Sellers
They use Horse.AI to:
- Prove their mare or stallion is throwing money
- Show embryos/foals/colts as "available"
- Catch buyers

**They no longer have to scream on Facebook and hope people believe them. Horse.AI shows proof.**

### Buyers
They use Horse.AI to:
- Find real bloodlines that are actually producing
- Ask "is this one for sale?" or "can I get cooled shipped on this stud?"
- Message through Request Info

**Now it's one click to get in touch with the real owner/handler, without scams and without having to guess if something is legit.**

## The Tier System (The Money Engine)

  - Or upgrade

*This converts curiosity into accurate data.*

## Safety and Compliance

- Every single outbound message the AI sends (SMS/email) is logged with STOP/unsubscribe
- All "Request Info" about a minor routes automatically to the parent/guardian contact
- Public pages show performance, payouts, times, bloodlines — NOT drama or accusations
- Users can request "Export My Data" and "Stop Contacting Me"
- We keep event results (public sport history) but remove contact info if they opt out

**This is how we scale without getting sued to death.**

---

## Global from Day One

Horse.AI is not U.S.-only.

- All inbound questions or Request Info messages can be in any language
- Someone in Brazil asks in Portuguese, the Texas seller sees English
- Texas replies in English, Brazil sees Portuguese
- We store canonical truth in English internally, so the AI can reason globally
- We support multiple disciplines: timed (barrels, poles, roping, breakaway) and judged/scored (reining, cutting, cow horse)
- We can route buyers by geography: "Buyer in Mexico asking about rope geldings"

**This is not just western U.S. jackpot girls. This is the global performance horse market.**

## The Flywheel

1. **Producers upload results** to look official → ledger grows
2. **Fans, riders, breeders look up horses** → HorseGPT usage explodes  
3. **Free users "pay with data"** when they hit the wall → owner info, sale status, breeding info fills in
4. **Owners pay $4.99/mo** to get VERIFIED, fix their listing, get alerts, and brag
5. **Buyers hit "Request Info"** → we generate real leads
6. **Sellers upgrade to $19.99/mo** to answer first, show up first, and catch the money
7. **That turns into sales, breedings, bookings, hauling, sponsorships**
8. **And every loop makes Horse.AI more accurate, more trusted, more valuable**

**Nobody else in the horse world is doing this because everyone else is stuck selling PDFs and spreadsheets. You're building the live scoreboard and the transaction layer.**

---
